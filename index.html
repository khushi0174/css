                    And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
                    We've come a long way from where we began
                    Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
                    When I see you again
                    Damn, who knew?
                    All the planes we flew, good things we been through
                    That I'd be standing right here talking to you
                    'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
                    But something told me that it wouldn't last
                    Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
                    Those were the days, hard work forever pays
                    Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
                    Uh
                    How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
                    Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
                    And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
                    It's been a long day without you, my friend
                    And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
